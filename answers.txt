Q.  In your own words, describe actions, reducers and the store and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application? 

A. Actions handle api requests,
   reducers set up initial state and tell what actions to fire,
   store gives the app access to reducers and middleware.


Q.  What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other? 

A. The difference between app state and component state is, app state is the "global" state and has access to all components in its tree, where component state is set to a single component that cannot be seen from outside of that component.


Q.  Describe redux-thunk, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our action-creators? 

A. Redux-thunk is a function that returns a function that is a asynchronous, which is useful for things like making an api request which will take an undetermined amount of time.
